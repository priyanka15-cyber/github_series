**TASK 1 ANSWERS**
**Q1. What do you mean by git and GitHub?**
</>Git is a piece of software that does version control system. It lets you manage and keep track of entire history that you are working on your computer.
                              Git is a particularly special tool which has a lot of advanced and sophisticated features for collaboration.First developed in 2005.
                              GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.


**Q2.  Why GitHub is so popular and used in most of the projects?**
</>GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.GitHub is the world's largest software development platform. It provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process.

**Q3. What is a version control system? How Git is a VCS?**
</>Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.


**Q4. What are the other platforms similar to GitHub?**
</>Other platforms similar to GitHub:-
i)GitLab
ii)SourceForge
iii)Google Cloud Source Repositories
iv)GitKraken
v)Apache Allura(Self-Hosted)
vi)BitBucket
vii)Launchpad
viii)AWS CodeCommit
ix)Phabricator
x)Gogs(Self-Hosted)


**Q5. Why are you interested in learning of Git and Github?**
</>i)Have your code reviewed by the community.
ii)GitHub is a repository, it allows your work to get out in front of the public.
iii)GitHub also tracks changes in a changelog, so you can know exactly what is changed each time.
iv)Use Multiple Integration Options

**TASK 2**
@channel Hey guys, I hope you all are doing great.

Once you completed all the tasks perfectly you need to do the following things to get marked as completed by our team
1. Share the link to the GitHub repository you have created.
2. Your README should contain a brief about the project and should be written in markdown language.
Drop the answer to the following questions
 a. How git workflow works?
 b. What're the different stages of a git project as commit, add?
 c. Is it possible to do a git commit before git add . if you have made any changes? Explain why?
 d. Why is git diff used?
 e. Can we leave the commit message as blank?

I expect the answers to be precise for the above questions. Please only
write what you have understood. If you are facing any difficulties drop
your question in the channel we would try to help our best.

Happy Hacking:smile:

**TASK 2 ANSWERS**
1. Share the link to the GitHub repository you have created.
https://github.com/priyanka15-cyber/python-program.git

2.Your README should contain a brief about the project and should be written in markdown language.
https://github.com/priyanka15-cyber/python-program/commit/b57954d30e579d44f02362f7e60cd22746bfb371

**a. How git workflow works?**
</>Git workflow works as:-
i)Create a new repository for your code on GitHub
ii)Add this as a remote for your local repository
iii)Make changes to your local repository as usual
iv)Upload or push your changes to the remote


 **b. What're the different stages of a git project as commit, add?**
 </>Three stages:-
 i)git status
 ii)git add <file>
 iii)git commit <option>
 
 **c. Is it possible to do a git commit before git add . if you have made any changes? Explain why?**
 </>No.
 Because modified file must be added before committing,you have to tell Git which changes you want to save.
 
 
**d. Why is git diff used?**
 </>To see the difference between the previous version and the committed one.
 git diff =compare repository with last commit
 
 
**e. Can we leave the commit message as blank?**
 </>No
 When i tried this= 
 git commmit -m
 error: switch `m' requires a value


**TASK 3**
Hey guys, I hope you all are doing great.
Here's the link to the google docs of a third-day task: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yDAjvfYT8Xc1OFk5NJU_-nO58tMrL0dS78thBKFlQig/edit?usp=sharing

a. What is meant by the term fork and clone?
b. What are branches in Github?

**TASK 3 ANSWERS**
Once you completed all the tasks perfectly you need to do the following things to get marked as completed by our team
1. Share the link of the PR you have made, so you need to submit the link of two PR's.
PR1 LINK=>   https://github.com/codewayy/github_series/pull/130
PR2 LINK=>   https://github.com/codewayy/github_series/pull/131

**a. What is meant by the term fork and clone?**
</>To contribute in someone's else project or to make others project as your starting point is called as forking.Create a 'fork' produces someone else project as our personal copy.Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.
                    Clone is copy of the target repository.
                    git-clone - "Clone a repository into a new directory"
                    

**b. What are branches in Github?**
</>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is "master". As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.


**c. What is PR?**
</>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.


**d. Can we delete the master branch if not Why?**
</>No.That is because github is looking at the master branch to provide the web content when you browse that repository. So we first have to make github look at our placeholder branch instead, then delete master.


**e. How can we delete a branch?**
</>Delete a branch LOCALLY:-
step1:git checkout master
step2:git branch -d <branch>.
      For example: git branch -d fix/authentication

The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.The branch is now deleted locally.

Deleting a branch REMOTELY:-
step1:git push <remote> --delete <branch>.
      For example: git push origin --delete fix/authentication
The branch is now deleted remotely.
OR,
You can also use this shorter command to delete a branch remotely: 
git push <remote> :<branch>
For example: git push origin :fix/authentication

**TASK 4**
[08:14, 7/10/2020] Priya_nka: @channel Here goes the day 4 task. 
The deadline to complete the task is by tomorrow 11 am.
Here's the link to the google docs of a fourth-day task:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/15pg8nxssKWuMEfm8hsykVbmxJ-L6Q_XB8z-nNn7qO0Q/edit?usp=sharing
Once you completed all the tasks we would update you in the group after that you need to answer the following tasks:
 1.What do you mean by merge conflicts?
 2. Can we have 200 different branches other than the master?
 3. What's the difference between git branch -d and git branch - D?

Regards
Codewayy

**TASK 4 ANSWERS**
1.What do you mean by merge conflicts?
 </>A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.However, when there are conflicting changes on the same lines, a “merge conflict” occurs because Git doesn’t know which code to keep and which to discard.
 
2. Can we have 200 different branches other than the master?
</> Yes,we can. 
 
3. What's the difference between git branch -d and git branch - D?
 </> The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.The branch is now deleted locally.
